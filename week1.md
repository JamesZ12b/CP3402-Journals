### CP3402 First Week Learning Journal

**Week 1: Subject Intro & Web Design Basics**
**Date:** 20/09/2024
**Estimated Hours:** 6 hours

#### **Learning Activities & Resources:**
This week, I focused on reviewing the fundamentals of web design, specifically HTML and CSS, as required for the practical task. I recalled that HTML is used for the content and structure of a website, while CSS is for styling, and it's best to keep them in separate files.

#### **Challenges Encountered:**
I faced a challenge when configuring the S3 bucket on AWS for web hosting. To resolve this issue, I consulted the official AWS documentation and successfully addressed the problem.

#### **Practical:**
My startup idea is "Archivio," a platform for curating and promoting student projects that might not get visibility on larger platforms. For this week's practical, I created a simple static website with three pages: a homepage, a project library, and a project detail page. The website is built with plain HTML and CSS, following the week's learning objectives. I hosted the website using AWS S3 after configuring the bucket for public access.

#### **References:**
* My AWS S3 Website URL: `http://eztest001.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/`

#### **Content Insights:**
Revisiting web design principles was a crucial step for this subject, as it forms the foundational knowledge for Content Management Systems. I've come to understand that effective web design involves not only the technical aspects of HTML and CSS but also a strategic approach to planning the website's goals and content to engage a target audience.

#### **Career/Employability/Learning Insights:**
This practical task provided valuable hands-on experience in the web development lifecycle, from basic coding to website hosting. Understanding how static sites are built and hosted is a foundational skill that will be highly relevant for my future career, especially as I move on to dynamic sites and CMS in this course. This knowledge will be directly applicable to building and maintaining professional websites.
