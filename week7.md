(Completing PHP practical, group project planning)

### **Week 7 - PHP Programming** 

**Learning Activities & Resources:**

This week's work was split into two parts: an individual technical exercise and team-based project planning.

1.  **Individual PHP Practical (Prac 7-PHP):**
    * I completed the personal PHP exercise, creating a small, multi-page website to demonstrate the five core requirements.
    * **`include`:** I created a reusable `header.php` and `footer.php`, which were included in both `index.php` and `about.php`.
    * **Array & `foreach` Loop:** I created an array in `index.php` holding my Assignment 1 project titles and their statuses. I used a `foreach` loop to iterate over this array.
    * **Function with Parameters:** I defined a custom function `displayProject($title, $status)` to handle the output logic for each project.
    * **`if/else` Decision & `echo`:** Inside the function, I used `if/else` to check the project status and `echo` to output the corresponding HTML with different colors.
    * I also reviewed the recommended LinkedIn Learning courses on PHP basics.

2.  **Group Project Work (Assignment 2):**
    * As assumed, our team channel (`CP3402-GroupB`) is now active, and I have successfully connected with my teammate, Ziyu Cao.
    * We held our first planning session for Assignment 2.
    * We reviewed the client materials, specifically the meeting notes (`A01 Client Meeting 15th Sep 2025.docx`) to understand the website's goals and required pages (Home, Gallery, Visit Us, etc.).
    * We discussed the technical requirements in the project guide (`CP3402-2025-Project.pdf`), focusing on the fact that we **must** build a custom theme from a starter, not a child theme.
    * We began breaking down these requirements into initial tasks on our Trello board.

**Resources/Links:**
* LinkedIn Learning: Introducing PHP 
* LinkedIn Learning: PHP with MySQL Essential Training 
* My submitted PHP files (`index.php`, `about.php`, `header.php`, `footer.php`)
* Team Trello Board
* Assignment 2 Project Guide & Client Materials

**Estimated Hours:**
4.0 hours (1.5 hours on the PHP prac, 2.5 hours on group planning and reviewing A2 requirements)

**Content Insights:**

This PHP practical was a perfect bridge to Assignment 2. The `include` function is the foundational concept behind how WordPress themes work; `get_header()` and `get_footer()` are essentially just complex, built-in versions of this exact principle. Creating a modular structure with `header.php` and `footer.php` makes it clear why developing a custom theme (as required in A2) is so much more powerful than just modifying a child theme. You build the structure from the ground up.

**Career/Employability/Learning Insights:**

This week provided a clear contrast between solo execution and team planning. The PHP exercise was a straightforward individual coding task. However, the group planning for Assignment 2 required a completely different set of "soft skills". Now that communication with the team is established, we were able to review the client documents (`A01 Client Meeting...docx`), divide roles, and start populating our Trello board with tasks. Having the Trello and Slack tools set up from last week made this first planning session much more efficient. We are now able to function like a small development team, which is a core goal of this project.
